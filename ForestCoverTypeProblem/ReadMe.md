##Forest Cover Type updates and progress
Here is my source code for the infamous forest cover type problem. In which my random forest model I created was able to obtain 84-86% accuracy on the validation data subset provided. 

The LightGBM model did not do as well as I thought it would. I will be building an XGBoost model for the problem as of 3/1, however the execution time for XGBoost models is an inconvenience. So I must ensure I have the training split optimized prior to implementing an XGBoost model for this problem.
