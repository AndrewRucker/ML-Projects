## H2 Forest Cover Type updates and progress

This is a repository for my work on the forest cover type problem that is based on the dataset provided by the UC Irvin machine learning repository. I will give constant updates along with updating my notebooks in the repository.

### H3 3/1
The LightGBM model did not do as well as I thought it would. I will be building an XGBoost model for the problem, however the execution time for XGBoost models is an inconvenience. So I must ensure I have the training split optimized prior to implementing an XGBoost model for this problem.
